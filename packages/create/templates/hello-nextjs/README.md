# DBOS Background Job

This is a [DBOS app](https://docs.dbos.dev/) bootstrapped with `npx @dbos-inc/create`, using [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [Knex](https://docs.dbos.dev/typescript/tutorials/programmingmodel/orms/using-knex) to interact with postgres.

## Getting Started

Before you can launch your app, you need a database.
DBOS works with any Postgres database, but to make things easier, we've provided a script that starts a Docker Postgres container and creates a database.
Run:

```bash
node start_postgres_docker.js
```

If successful, the script should print `Database started successfully!`.

```

## Production build

In production, instead of using `nodemon`, the following separate steps should be used to build, run database setup, and start the app.

```bash
npm run build
```

Then, run a schema migration to create some tables:

```bash
npx dbos migrate
```

If successful, the migration should print `Migration successful!`.

Finally, run the app:

```bash
npm run start
```

To see that it's working, visit this URL in your browser: [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/).

Click on the "Start Background Job" button.

You should this message: `Your background task has completed step 0 of 9.`
As the background job completes steps, the step counter should go up by one!

Click on "Crash the application" button.

The step counter stops increasing.
On the command line, you will see that the application has stopped.
Start the application again.
```bash
npm run start
```
In the browser, you will see that the execution of steps resumes where it left off and eventually completes.

Congratulations! You just run a DBOS application.

## The application

- In `src/action/dbosWorkflow.tsx`, the DBOS workflow is created. When called, it increments a counter in the database and returns a greeting.

- The code below in the same file, launches the dbos runtime. This is required for DBOS runtime to start. Do not remove the code
```
if (process.env.NEXT_PHASE !== "phase-production-build") {
    await DBOS.launch();
}
```
- The workflow for the background job is called by the called the GET method in app/tasks/route.ts.

- The GET is called by the component in src/components/BackGroundTask.tsx. It calls the route /tasks.

- The component is called from the main UI page.tsx.

- This is how the DBOS workflow is wired to the NextJs application.


 DBOS will wrap all routes with an [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) tracing middleware and tie HTTP traces to DBOS workflow traces.

To add more functionality to this application, modify `src/operations.ts`. If you used `npm run dev`, it will automatically rebuild and restart.

## Running in DBOS Cloud

To deploy this app to DBOS Cloud, first install the DBOS Cloud CLI (example with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)):

```shell
npm i -g @dbos-inc/dbos-cloud
```

Then, run this command to deploy your app:

```shell
dbos-cloud app deploy
```
