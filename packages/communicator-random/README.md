# DBOS Random Step

This is a [DBOS](https://docs.dbos.dev/) [step](https://docs.dbos.dev/tutorials/communicator-tutorial) for generating random numbers.

The reason that random number generation should be wrapped in a `@DBOS.step` is so that replayed workflows get the recorded value and therefore have the same behavior as the original.

## Available Functions

### `DBOSRandom.random()`
`DBOSRandom.random` is a wrapper for `Math.random()` and similarly produces a `number` in the range from 0 to 1.
