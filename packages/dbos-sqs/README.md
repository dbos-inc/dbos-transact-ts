# DBOS AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) Library

Message queues are a common building block for distributed systems.  Message queues allow processing to occur at a different place or time, perhaps in another programming environment.  Due to its flexibility, robustness, integration, and low cost, [Amazon Simple Queue Service](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) is the most popular message queuing service underpinning distributed systems in AWS.

This package includes a [DBOS](https://docs.dbos.dev/) [communicator](https://docs.dbos.dev/tutorials/communicator-tutorial) for sending messages using SQS, as well as an event receiver for exactly-once processing of incoming messages (even using standard queues).

## Getting Started
In order to send and receive messages with SQS, it is necessary to register with AWS, create a queue, and create access keys for the queue. (See [Send Messages Between Distributed Applications](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/send-messages-distributed-applications/) in AWS documentation.)

## Configuring a DBOS Application with AWS SQS
First, ensure that the DBOS SQS package is installed into the application:
```
npm install --save @dbos-inc/dbos-sqs
```

Second, place appropriate configuration into the [`dbos-config.yaml`](https://docs.dbos.dev/api-reference/configuration) file; the following example will pull the AWS information from the environment:
```yaml
application:
  aws_sqs_configuration: aws_config # Optional if the section is called `aws_config`
  aws_config:
    aws_region: ${AWS_REGION}
    aws_access_key_id: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
    aws_secret_access_key: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
```

If a different configuration file section should be used for SQS, the `aws_sqs_configuration` can be changed to indicate a configuration section for use with SQS.  If multiple configurations are to be used, the application code is responsible for naming them.

## Sending Messages

### Imports
First, ensure that the communicator is imported:
```typescript
import { SQSCommunicator } from "@dbos-inc/dbos-sqs";
```

### Selecting A Configuration
`SQSCommunicator` is a configured class.  This means that the configuration (or config file key name) must be provided when a class instance is created, for example:
```typescript
const sqsCfg = configureInstance(SQSCommunicator, 'default', {awscfgname: 'aws_config'});
```

### Sending With Standard Queues
Within a [DBOS Transact Workflow](https://docs.dbos.dev/tutorials/workflow-tutorial), invoke the `SQSCommunicator` function from the workflow context:
```typescript
    const sendRes = await ctx.invoke(sqsCfg).sendMessage(
        {
            MessageBody: "{/*app data goes here*/}",
        },
    );
```

### FIFO Queues
Sending to [SQS FIFO queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-fifo-queues.html) is the same as with standard queues, except that FIFO queues need a `MessageDeduplicationId` (or content-based deduplication) and can be sharded by a `MessageGroupId`.

```typescript
    const sendRes = await ctx.invoke(sqsCfg).sendMessage(
        {
            MessageBody: "{/*app data goes here*/}",
            MessageDeduplicationId: "Message key goes here",
            MessageGroupId: "Message grouping key goes here",
        },
    );
```

## Receiving Messages

The DBOS SQS receiver provides the capability of running DBOS Transact workflows exactly once per SQS message, even on standard "at-least-once" SQS queues.  

The package uses decorators to configure message receipt and identify the functions that will be invoked during message dispatch.

### Imports
First, ensure that the method decorators are imported:
```typescript
import { SQSMessageConsumer, SQSConfigure } from "@dbos-inc/dbos-sqs";
```

### Receiver Configuration
The `@SQSConfigure` decorator should be applied at the class level to identify the credentials useed by receiver functions in the class:
```typescript
interface SQSConfig {
    awscfgname?: string;
    awscfg?: AWSServiceConfig;
    queueUrl?: string;
    getWFKey?: (m: Message) => string; // Calculate workflow OAOO key for each message
    workflowQueueName?: string;
}

@SQSConfigure({awscfgname: 'sqs_receiver'})
class SQSEventProcessor {
    ...
}
```

Then, within the class, one or more methods should be decorated to handle SQS messages:
```typescript
@SQSConfigure({awscfgname: 'sqs_receiver'})
class SQSEventProcessor {
  @SQSMessageConsumer({queueUrl: process.env['SQS_QUEUE_URL']})
  @Workflow()
  static async recvMessage(ctx: WorkflowContext, msg: Message) {
    // Workflow code goes here...
  }
}
```

### Concurrency and Rate Limiting
By default, `@SQSMessageConsumer` workflows are started immediately after message receipt.  If `workflowQueueName` is specified in the `SQSConfig` at either the method or class level, then the workflow will be enqueued in a [workflow queue](https://docs.dbos.dev/typescript/reference/workflow-queues).

### Once-And-Only-Once (OAOO) Semantics
Typical application processing for standard SQS queues implements "at least once" processing of the message:
* Receive the message from the SQS queue
* If necessary, extend the visibility timeout of the message during the course of processing
* After all processing is complete, delete the message from the queue
If there are any failures, the message will remain in the queue and be redelivered to another consumer.

The DBOS receiver proceeds differently:
* Receive the message from the SQS queue
* Start a workflow (using an OAOO key computed from the message)
* Quickly delete the message

This means that, instead of the SQS service redelivering the message in the case of a transient failure, it is up to DBOS to restart any interrupted workflows.  Also, since DBOS workflows execute to completion exactly once, it is not necessary to use a SQS FIFO queue for exactly-once processing.

## Simple Testing
The `sqs.test.ts` file included in the source repository demonstrates sending and processing SQS messages.  Before running, set the following environment variables:
- `SQS_QUEUE_URL`: SQS queue URL with access for sending and receiving messages
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region to use
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: The access key with permission to use the SQS service
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: The secret access key corresponding to `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
