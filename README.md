# Operon

## What is Operon?

Operon is a **Typescript framework for the backend**.
Operon enables you to write backend applications that work right by default, providing native support for application database management, reliable workflow execution, OpenTelemetry-compatible tracing, authentication/authorizaton, and much more.

Unlike in other backend frameworks, your application database is a _first-class citizen_ of Operon.
Operon makes writing database operations painless for you, regardless of whether you prefer raw SQL or an ORM.
Under the hood, we also leverage the database to give you _reliable workflows_, so you can write programs that are guaranteed to run to completion despite failures and always resume where they left off when your application is restarted.

Operon is also the [**SDK for DBOS's upcoming serverless cloud platform**](https://dbos.dev).
In the near future, you'll be able to deploy any Operon application serverlessly to the cloud with the push of a button, running effortlessly at scale without worrying about managing infrastructure.
