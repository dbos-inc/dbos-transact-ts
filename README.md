# Operon

Operon (from [DBOS, Inc.](https://dbos.dev)) is a **Typescript framework built on the database** that helps you develop database-backed backend applications.
Operon fully embraces the power of your application database, helping you write backend applications that are reliable by default.
It runs your Typescript functions as database transactions, guarantees they run "once and only once" for each request, and orchestrates them into workflows so reliable that if your server restarts, they resume exactly where they left off.

In the near future, DBOS Inc. expects to release a hosted cloud runtime for Operon applications.
This scalable, secure runtime will allow you to deploy applications written for the Operon SDK with the push of a button.
Also coming soon is our cloud “time-travel” debugger, which will set up and replay any scenario that occurred in production for analysis in the development environment.
This hosting platform and debugger comprise a revolutionary system software stack inspired by research prototypes developed over the last three years at MIT and Stanford.

## Getting Started

The fastest way to get started with Operon is by following the [quickstart](https://docs.dbos.dev/getting-started/quickstart), where you'll learn how to get a backend running in less than five minutes.
